      - Outputs
        - "work with output leads to detremine resource needs"
        - Output feels very different than a task - bigger and a synthesis role.  Doesn't feel like real work.  Regurgitating what is done at the product and research project levels
         - Products
      - Output leads:
        - ID Senior Scientist
        - Not actively involved in research.  This is a coordination effort
        - Feels similar to the former Project Leads
        - Desire for singular Lead, but can push for co-Leads.

      - Due early May, 2019
